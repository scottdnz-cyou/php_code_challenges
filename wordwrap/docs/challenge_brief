...a small coding challenge before this interview that will help us assess some 
of your coding skills.

It should be a fairly quick exercise but it is not a race so please take as long 
as you need and feel free to ask questions.

The task is to write a function called 'wrap' that takes two arguments, $string 
and $length.

The function should return the string, but with new lines ("\n") added to ensure 
that no line is longer than $length characters. 
Always wrap at word boundaries if possible, only break a word if it is longer 
than $length characters. 
When breaking at word boundaries, replace all the whitespace between the two 
words with a single newline character. 
Any unbroken whitespace should be left unchanged.

Please implement the function directly in PHP, rather than using the built-in
 wordwrap() function.

Pseudo:

Have a word, then a non-word char.

if non-word char is a space, and beyond len of line:
    -ignore the space
    -if word can fit in line, add the word
        -otherwise, add the word to next line

if non-word char is not a space, and beyond len of line:
    if word & non-word char can fit in line, add the word
        -otherwise, add the word & non-word char to next line
